# 1 Linear Regression
    * The mathematical technique to find a line (or curve) that best matches the points of data
    that you collected is called regression.

# 2 KNN Classification
    * KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor) is a simple supervised classification algorithm we can use to assign a class to new data point.
     It can be used for regression as well, KNN does not make any assumptions on the data distribution, hence it is non-parametric.

# 3 Logistic Regression
    * Logistic Regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used in binary classification.
